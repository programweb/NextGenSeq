# NextGenSeq

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also called high-throughput sequencing technologies, generate vast amounts of data that needs to be processed.  NGS enables rapid and cost-effective DNA or RNA sequencing. The desired result of NGS is to obtain a comprehensive and accurate representation of the nucleotide sequence of a given sample. The specific goals and applications of NGS can vary, but some common desired results include:
* Genome Sequencing: NGS can be used to sequence entire genomes, providing a complete map of an organism's genetic material. This can be valuable for understanding genetic variations, studying evolution, and identifying disease-related mutations.
* Exome Sequencing: Exome sequencing focuses on the protein-coding regions of the genome (exons). It is particularly useful for identifying genetic variations associated with diseases linked to changes in protein-coding genes.
* RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq): NGS is used to sequence the transcriptome, providing information about the types and quantities of RNA molecules present in a sample. This is essential for studying gene expression, alternative splicing, and identifying non-coding RNAs.
* Epigenetic Profiling: NGS can be applied to study epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications.
* Metagenomics: NGS allows the sequencing of entire microbial communities in a sample, providing insights into the composition and functional potential of the microbiome. This is important for studying microbial ecology, disease associations, and other related fields.
* Cancer Genomics: NGS is extensively used in cancer research to identify genetic mutations, characterize tumor heterogeneity, and guide personalized treatment approaches.
* Clinical Diagnostics: NGS has applications in clinical settings for diagnosing genetic disorders, identifying disease-causing mutations, and guiding treatment decisions based on an individual's genetic profile.
* Evolutionary Biology: NGS is employed to study the evolutionary relationships between species, populations, or individuals by comparing their genetic sequences.
